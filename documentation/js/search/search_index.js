find the complete documentation in the folder documentation. Opening index.html will provide an interface for viewing the documentation properly.\nThe documentation can be updated after changes by running npm run compodoc\nRunning the application\nYou have to have the Chrome browser installed because the tests utilize Chrome.\n\nrun npm i to install dependencies\nrun npm run gulp-run to build and run docker container and to start the application\ngo to localhost:4200\n\nAfter completing the build process the application needs a few seconds for the docker container to be ready. If localhost:4200 does not open the application, wait a few seconds and reload the page.\nStopping the application\nTo stop the application run npm run gulp-stop\nTo start the application again run npm run gulp-start\nTo stop the application and destroy the docker containers and images run npm run gulp-destroy\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
